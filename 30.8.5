To correctly perform the cumulative subtraction operation on the `Outstanding2` column for each row in your SQL Server view, we need to calculate the remaining balance of `Outstanding2` using a `WHILE` loop or a window function like `SUM() OVER()` for running totals. However, since views don't support `WHILE` loops directly, we will use a window function to simulate the cumulative subtraction.

Here's how you can update your view to correctly calculate `Outstanding2`:

```sql
CREATE VIEW [dbo].[tmpvw] AS

    ISNULL(po.PurchaseOrderNo, '') AS PurchaseOrderNo,  
    ISNULL(po.SiteName, '') AS SiteName,

        FROM materials mat  
        WHERE mat.materialid IN (  
            SELECT MaterialId  
            FROM PurchaseOrdersDetails AS pod1  
            WHERE pod1.PurchaseOrderId = podetailgroup.PurchaseOrderId  
            AND pod1.NominalCodeId = podetailgroup.NominalCodeId  
        )  
        FOR XML PATH('')  
    ), 1, 1, '') AS MaterialName,  
    ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCode, '') AS NominalCode,  
    ISNULL(podetailgroup.NominalCodeName, '') AS NominalCodeDesc,

### Explanation:
- The query uses the `SUM()` function with the `OVER()` clause to create a running total that considers all preceding rows.
- The logic calculates `Outstanding2` by cumulatively subtracting `Outstanding` from `Outstanding2`, ensuring the correct remaining balance is calculated at each step.
- The `ORDER BY` in the `OVER()` clause ensures that the subtraction occurs in the correct sequence based on the `CreatedDate` or another relevant column.

This should solve the issue where your calculation was incorrectly resetting for each row.
