Outstanding		Outstanding2
0.00			3507.84
11.88			3495.96
431.57			3076.27

i sql server database want to do a minus operation that is Outstanding2 = Outstanding2 - Outstanding for everrow
so for 1 row -> 3507.84 - 0.00 = 3507.84 that is correct
2 row - remaining balance of 1 row of Outstanding2 -> 3507.84 - 11.88 = 3495.96
3 row -> 3495.96 - 431-57 = 3064.39 but i am getting 3076.27 which is incorrect because its subtracting from 1st row value of Outstanding2
please write me a correct query for this operation
