To ensure that you get only the last batch of data for each day (including today), you can modify the `FetchDataFromDatabase` method to select the maximum `BatchId` for each day. This will ensure that the output file contains data from the last batch of each day.

Hereâ€™s how you can adjust your query:

### Updated `FetchDataFromDatabase` Method:

```csharp
private DataTable FetchDataFromDatabase()
{
    var dataTable = new DataTable();

    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["DefaultConnection"].ConnectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();

        // Query to fetch the last batch of data for each day
        string query = @"
            SELECT Date, Agent, TimesheetOwner, TotalTalkingTime, Division 
            FROM OutputFileDetails
            WHERE BatchId IN (
                SELECT MAX(BatchId)
                FROM OutputFileDetails
                GROUP BY CAST(CreatedDateTime AS DATE)
            )";

        using (var command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))
        {
            using (var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(command))
            {
                adapter.Fill(dataTable);
            }
        }
    }

    return dataTable;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Selecting the Last Batch per Day**: 
  - The subquery inside the `IN` clause (`SELECT MAX(BatchId) FROM OutputFileDetails GROUP BY CAST(CreatedDateTime AS DATE)`) retrieves the highest `BatchId` for each unique date, ensuring you only get the last batch of data for each day.
  
- **Filtering by `BatchId`**: 
  - The outer query then selects records from `OutputFileDetails` where the `BatchId` matches any of these maximum values, effectively filtering the dataset to include only the last batch for each day.

### Benefits:
- **One Record per Day**: This approach guarantees that for each day, only the last set of inserted records (as determined by `BatchId`) will be included in the output file.
  
- **Efficiency**: By grouping data by date and selecting the maximum `BatchId`, this method is efficient and ensures accurate data retrieval.

### Testing:
- Ensure that when new batches are inserted into the table, they are assigned incrementally higher `BatchId`s, and verify that the output file correctly reflects the last batch for each day.

This adjustment should give you exactly what you need: an output file containing only the most recent batch of data for each day, including today.
