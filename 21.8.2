To perform the update operation you described in SQL Server, you can use the following query. The goal is to subtract the `NoOfDays` from the `TotalHours` in the `RotaDetails` table, based on the matching `PracticeId` and `EmployeeId` from the `LeaveDetails` table:

```sql
UPDATE RD
SET RD.TotalHours = RD.TotalHours - LD.NoOfDays
FROM RotaDetails RD
JOIN LeaveDetails LD ON RD.PracticeId = LD.PracticeId AND RD.EmployeeId = LD.EmployeeId
WHERE RD.PracticeId = 1015 AND RD.EmployeeId = 1012;
```

### Explanation:
- **`UPDATE RD`**: This specifies the alias for the `RotaDetails` table to be updated.
- **`SET RD.TotalHours = RD.TotalHours - LD.NoOfDays`**: This subtracts the `NoOfDays` from the `LeaveDetails` table from the `TotalHours` column in the `RotaDetails` table.
- **`FROM RotaDetails RD JOIN LeaveDetails LD`**: This joins the `RotaDetails` table with the `LeaveDetails` table based on `PracticeId` and `EmployeeId`.
- **`WHERE RD.PracticeId = 1015 AND RD.EmployeeId = 1012`**: This ensures the update is applied only to the specific `PracticeId` and `EmployeeId`.

### Common Issues:
- If youâ€™re getting the wrong results, double-check the `NoOfDays` values in `LeaveDetails` and the initial `TotalHours` in `RotaDetails` to ensure they are correct.
- Make sure the data types of `TotalHours` and `NoOfDays` are compatible for subtraction.
  
This query should update the `TotalHours` in the `RotaDetails` table as expected. If you're still encountering issues, please share the specific incorrect result you're getting, and we can further troubleshoot.
